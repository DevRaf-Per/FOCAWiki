In this brief tutorial, we will see how to set up Google searches with FOCA. As we know, FOCA searches are a key part of the process of discovering documents containing metadata in a given domain.

The first step will be to identify ourselves in Google at the following URL using your Google account:

`https://developers.google.com/`

Click on the _Get a Key_ button, and give a name to the project:

Finally, weÂ´ll get the API key (save it for later):

The next step will be to tune the search parameters using the Google API:

`https://cse.google.com/create/new?refresh=1`

In the sites to search insert a URL (we can change it later) and the name that we will give to this customized search engine, as you can see in the following picture:

Once created, we will be able to see the Search Engine ID that we will then use in FOCA. But first, we must define what kind of searches we want to do:

### Set up searches on specific URLs:
In the section _Sites to Search_ we add as many domains as we want to check:

### Search the entire web:

We just activate the button _Search the entire web_. 
This would be the optimal setting for FOCA.

Once we have already set everything up, start FOCA and access to the options menu where we will see the following screen:

In the Google API KEY section enter the code we got in the first phase and in Google Custom Search CX the code that appears in the Custom Search we've created. Click on Save and FOCA will be configured to use Google Search Engine at maximum power.
